	abstract = {Intensity interferometry for astrophysical observations has gained increasing interest in the last decade. The method of correlating photon fluxes at different telescopes for high resolution astronomy without access to the phase of the incoming light is insensitive to atmospheric turbulence and doesn't require high-precision optical path control. The necessary large collection areas can be provided by Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. Implementation of intensity interferometers to existing telescope systems such as VERITAS and MAGIC has proven to be successful for high-resolution imaging of stars. In April 2022 we equipped two telescopes of the H.E.S.S. array in Namibia with an intensity interferometry setup to measure southern sky stars and star systems during the bright moon period. We mounted an external optical system to the lid of the telescope cameras, which splits the incoming light and feeds it into two photomultipliers in order to measure the zero-baseline correlation within one telescope in addition to the cross correlation between the telescopes. The optical elements are motorised, which enables live correction of tracking inaccuracies of the telescopes. During the campaign we measured the spatial correlation curves and thereby the angular diameters of \{{\textbackslash}lambda\} Sco (Shaula) and \{{\textbackslash}sigma\} Sgr (Nunki), while we also performed systematic studies of our interferometer using the multiple star system of \{{\textbackslash}alpha\} Cru (Acrux).},

	abstract = {Astronomical intensity interferometry enables quantitative measurements of the source geometry by measuring the photon fluxes in individual telescopes and correlating them, rather than correlating the electromagnetic waves' amplitudes. This simplifies realization of large telescope baselines and high angular resolutions. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), intended to detect the optical emission of \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray induced air showers, are excellent candidates to perform intensity correlations in the optical at reasonable signal-to-noise ratios. The detected coherence time is on the scale of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-12\}\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\${\textasciitilde}seconds - depending on the optical bandwidth of the measurement - which challenges the detection system to work in a stable and accurate way. We developed an intensity interferometry setup applicable to IACTs, which measures the photo currents from photomultipliers and correlates them offline, and as such is designed to handle the very large photon rates provided by the telescopes. We present measurements in the lab simulating starlight using a xenon lamp and measured at different degrees of temporal and spatial coherence. Necessary calibration procedures are described with the goal of understanding the measurements quantitatively. Measured coherence times between \$5{\textbackslash},\$femtoseconds (corresponding signal-to-background ratio \$5{\textbackslash}cdot10{\textasciicircum}\{-7\}\$) and \$110{\textbackslash},\$femtoseconds (signal-to-background ratio \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$) are in good agreement with expectations, and so are the noise levels in the correlations, reaching down to \$6 {\textbackslash}cdot 10{\textasciicircum}\{-8\}\$, after measurements between \$30{\textbackslash},\$minutes and \$1{\textbackslash},\$ hour.},

	abstract = {Most observational techniques in astronomy can be understood as exploiting the various forms of the ﬁrst-order correlation function g(1). As demonstrated by the Narrabri stellar intensity interferometer back in the 1960s by Hanbury Brown \& Twiss, the ﬁrst experiment to measure the second-order correlation function g(2), light can carry more information than simply its intensity, spectrum, and polarization. Since this experiment, theoretical and laboratory studies of non-classical properties of light have become a very active ﬁeld of research, called quantum optics. Despite the variety of results in this ﬁeld, astrophysics remained focused essentially on ﬁrst-order coherence. In this paper, we study the possibility that quantum properties of light could be observed in cosmic sources. We provide the basic mathematical ingredients about the ﬁrst and the second order correlation functions, applied to the modern context of astronomical observations. We aim at replacing the Hanbury Brown \& Twiss experiment in this context, and present two fundamental limitations of an intensity interferometer: the requirement of a chaotic light source and the rapid decrease of the amount of correlated ﬂuctuations with the surface temperature. The ﬁrst of these limitations paradoxically emphasizes that the exploitation of g(2) is richer than what a modern intensity interferometer could bring and is particularly interesting for sources of nonthermal light. We also discuss new photon-counting avalanche photodiodes currently being developed in Grenoble, and their impact on limiting magnitudes of an intensity interferometer. We conclude by brieﬂy presenting why microquasars in our galaxy and their extragalactic parents can represent an excellent ﬁrst target in the optical/near-infrared where to observe nonthermal light and to test the use of g(2) in astrophysical sources.},
