  abstract = {Classical interferometry works by detecting correlations in the phases of two waves. In Nature in 1956, R. Hanbury-Brown and R. Q. Twiss demonstrated another technique that probes quantum-mechanical correlations in the electromagnetic field. Splitting an incoherent light beam, they found that photon detections in the two daughter beams were correlated: the photons were bunching together. This corresponds to a correlation in the intensity of light in the two beams, which Hanbury-Brown and Twiss suggested could be used to infer the angular size of distant stars. Physicists now rely on the effect to probe the quantum character of complex light sources. [Obituary of Robert Hanbury Brown: Nature 416, 34 (2002)]},

  abstract = {We present the first Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the Galactic center source associated with a supermassive black hole. These observations were conducted in 2017 using a global interferometric array of eight telescopes operating at a wavelength of λ = 1.3 mm. The EHT data resolve a compact emission region with intrahour variability. A variety of imaging and modeling analyses all support an image that is dominated by a bright, thick ring with a diameter of 51.8 ± 2.3 μas (68\% credible interval). The ring has modest azimuthal brightness asymmetry and a comparatively dim interior. Using a large suite of numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the EHT images of Sgr A* are consistent with the expected appearance of a Kerr black hole with mass ∼4 × 106 M ⊙, which is inferred to exist at this location based on previous infrared observations of individual stellar orbits, as well as maser proper-motion studies. Our model comparisons disfavor scenarios where the black hole is viewed at high inclination (i {$>$} 50°), as well as nonspinning black holes and those with retrograde accretion disks. Our results provide direct evidence for the presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, and for the first time we connect the predictions from dynamical measurements of stellar orbits on scales of 103–105 gravitational radii to event-horizon-scale images and variability. Furthermore, a comparison with the EHT results for the supermassive black hole M87* shows consistency with the predictions of general relativity spanning over three orders of magnitude in central mass.},

SUSI has been developed to tackle a range of problems in stellar astrophysics, and its design is based on a successful prototype instrument. In its initial configuration, observations are made with a single baseline selected from an array of fixed north—south baselines covering the range from 5 to 640 m. Small apertures, wavefront-tilt correction and rapid signal sampling are employed to overcome the effects of atmospheric turbulence, and optical path equality is maintained by a dynamic optical delay line. The planned astrophysical programmes, the resulting design criteria, the instrument and its current status are described.},

  abstract = {Most observational techniques in astronomy can be understood as exploiting the various forms of the first-order correlation function g(1). As demonstrated by the Narrabri stellar intensity interferometer back in the 1960s by Hanbury Brown \& Twiss, the first experiment to measure the second-order correlation function g(2), light can carry more information than simply its intensity, spectrum, and polarization. Since this experiment, theoretical and laboratory studies of non-classical properties of light have become a very active field of research, called quantum optics. Despite the variety of results in this field, astrophysics remained focused essentially on first-order coherence. In this paper, we study the possibility that quantum properties of light could be observed in cosmic sources. We provide the basic mathematical ingredients about the first and the second order correlation functions, applied to the modern context of astronomical observations. We aim at replacing the Hanbury Brown \& Twiss experiment in this context, and present two fundamental limitations of an intensity interferometer: the requirement of a chaotic light source and the rapid decrease of the amount of correlated fluctuations with the surface temperature. The first of these limitations paradoxically emphasizes that the exploitation of g(2) is richer than what a modern intensity interferometer could bring and is particularly interesting for sources of nonthermal light. We also discuss new photon-counting avalanche photodiodes currently being developed in Grenoble, and their impact on limiting magnitudes of an intensity interferometer. We conclude by briefly presenting why microquasars in our galaxy and their extragalactic parents can represent an excellent first target in the optical/near-infrared where to observe nonthermal light and to test the use of g(2) in astrophysical sources.},

  abstract = {The maximum visibility of the interferences obtainable from two points in a wave field is defined as their degree of coherence γ. By a simple statistical method general formulae are found for deducing γ from illumination data. For any extended lightsource γ is found equal to the amplitude in a certain diffraction image. It does not change by the use of a condensing lens, but depends only on the aperture of the illuminating cone. These properties are applied to the microscopic observation of objects in transmitted light.},

  abstract = {Intensity interferometry for astrophysical observations has gained increasing interest in the last decade. The method of correlating photon fluxes at different telescopes for high resolution astronomy without access to the phase of the incoming light is insensitive to atmospheric turbulence and doesn't require high-precision optical path control. The necessary large collection areas can be provided by Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. Implementation of intensity interferometers to existing telescope systems such as VERITAS and MAGIC has proven to be successful for high-resolution imaging of stars. In April 2022 we equipped two telescopes of the H.E.S.S. array in Namibia with an intensity interferometry setup to measure southern sky stars and star systems during the bright moon period. We mounted an external optical system to the lid of the telescope cameras, which splits the incoming light and feeds it into two photomultipliers in order to measure the zero-baseline correlation within one telescope in addition to the cross correlation between the telescopes. The optical elements are motorised, which enables live correction of tracking inaccuracies of the telescopes. During the campaign we measured the spatial correlation curves and thereby the angular diameters of \{\textbackslash lambda\} Sco (Shaula) and \{\textbackslash sigma\} Sgr (Nunki), while we also performed systematic studies of our interferometer using the multiple star system of \{\textbackslash alpha\} Cru (Acrux).},

  abstract = {Astronomical intensity interferometry enables quantitative measurements of the source geometry by measuring the photon fluxes in individual telescopes and correlating them, rather than correlating the electromagnetic waves' amplitudes. This simplifies realization of large telescope baselines and high angular resolutions. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), intended to detect the optical emission of \$\textbackslash gamma\$-ray induced air showers, are excellent candidates to perform intensity correlations in the optical at reasonable signal-to-noise ratios. The detected coherence time is on the scale of \$10\textasciicircum\{-12\}\$ to \$10\textasciicircum\{-15\}\$\textasciitilde seconds - depending on the optical bandwidth of the measurement - which challenges the detection system to work in a stable and accurate way. We developed an intensity interferometry setup applicable to IACTs, which measures the photo currents from photomultipliers and correlates them offline, and as such is designed to handle the very large photon rates provided by the telescopes. We present measurements in the lab simulating starlight using a xenon lamp and measured at different degrees of temporal and spatial coherence. Necessary calibration procedures are described with the goal of understanding the measurements quantitatively. Measured coherence times between \$5\textbackslash,\$femtoseconds (corresponding signal-to-background ratio \$5\textbackslash cdot10\textasciicircum\{-7\}\$) and \$110\textbackslash,\$femtoseconds (signal-to-background ratio \$10\textasciicircum\{-5\}\$) are in good agreement with expectations, and so are the noise levels in the correlations, reaching down to \$6 \textbackslash cdot 10\textasciicircum\{-8\}\$, after measurements between \$30\textbackslash,\$minutes and \$1\textbackslash,\$ hour.},
